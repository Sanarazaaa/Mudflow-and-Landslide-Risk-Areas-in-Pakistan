# Mudflow-and-Landslide-Risk-Areas-in-Pakistan

## Project Overview

This project aims to visualize mudflow and landslide risk areas in Pakistan using remote sensing data. The application provides an interactive web map that highlights regions at risk, allowing users to explore and understand the factors contributing to these natural hazards.

## Features

- **Interactive Map**: A Leaflet.js-based map centered on Pakistan, displaying areas at risk of mudflows and landslides.
- **GeoJSON Data**: Sample GeoJSON data representing high and moderate risk areas, which can be replaced with actual data from remote sensing analysis.
- **Dynamic Styling**: Areas are color-coded based on their risk level (red for high risk, orange for moderate risk).
- **Information Panel**: Clicking on a risk area displays detailed information about the area, including its risk description.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for specific locations within Pakistan (to be implemented in future versions).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS**: For the structure and styling of the web application.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and data handling.
- **Leaflet.js**: A JavaScript library for interactive maps.
- **GeoJSON**: A format for encoding geographic data structures.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):https://github.com/Sanarazaaa/Mudflow-and-Landslide-Risk-Areas-in-Pakistan
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Mudflow-and-Landslide-Risk-Areas-in-Pakistan.git
   cd mudflow-risk-visualization
   ```

2. **Open the HTML File**:
   - Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can do this by double-clicking the file or dragging it into an open browser window.

### Usage

- Once the application is open in your browser, you can interact with the map:
  - Click on the highlighted areas to view details about the risk level and description.
  - Explore the map to see different regions of Pakistan.

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate real-time data from APIs to provide up-to-date information on mudflow and landslide risks.
- Implement user input features to allow users to report landslides or mudflow incidents.
- Enhance the user interface for better usability and aesthetics.
- Add data visualization tools (charts/graphs) to analyze trends over time.
